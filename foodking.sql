(5, 'Flafel', 'Traditional falafel is made from ground chickpeas or fava beans, herbs and spices. The mixture is then formed into balls or patties and deep fried for a texture that’s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, sort of like a fritter. It’s a classic Middle Eastern and Mediterranean recipe that’s enjoyed as street food and often served up as part of mezze (a group of small meals).', 'Chickpeas (Garbanzo Beans): Only use dried and soaked chickpeas, not canned chickpeas in this recipe. Canned chickpeas will be too soft and wet and your falafel will not form properly.\r\nOnion: I use yellow onion for a slightly stronger flavor, but you could use white or red onion as well.\r\nParsley and Cilantro: These two delicious herbs inject heaps of flavor into your falafel and turn the inside a beautiful, vibrant green.\r\nGarlic: Use fresh garlic cloves rather than garlic powder for the most robust flavor.\r\nGreen Chile Pepper (Serrano Pepper): A small pepper adds a kick of flavor and spice without over-powering the falafel. You can adjust this to more or less, but don’t omit it without trying it first – trust me.\r\nCumin, Cardamom, Salt and Black Pepper: These aromatic spices are used often in Middle Eastern cooking and have an earthy, spicy, assertive flavor you’ll love.\r\nChickpea Flour: This helps to bind the mixture together and retain the shape while frying. I prefer chickpea flour, but you could also use a gluten-free flour blend.\r\nBaking Soda: A key ingredient for helping to provide the fluffy inside texture of the falafel.\r\nOil for Frying: I use avocado oil as it’s high-heat stable and my preferred cooking oil. But you could use vegetable oil as well.\r\n', '1.Soak your dried chickpeas. Overnight or for at least 8-12 hours. Note that the chickpeas will triple in size, so cover them with plenty of water. Then drain and rinse them.\r\n2.Add all the ingredients to a food processor. Add the chickpeas, onion, parsley, cilantro, garlic, green pepper and spices to a food processor. I recommend roughly chopping up the onion, herbs and pepper before adding. Pulse the food processor but do not blend completely. The final mixture should resemble coarse sand.\r\n3.Transfer the mixture to a bowl. Then add the chickpea flour and baking soda, stir it together until it’s fully combined and cover with plastic wrap or a lid.\r\nPlace the bowl in the fridge. Chill the falafel mixture for 30 minutes to 1 hour.\r\n4.Shape your falafel. You can do this by hand, with a cookie scoop (which is what I use) or a falafel scoop. 5.Decide if you’d like round balls or flatter patty shapes. The flatter shapes are better if you plan to pan fry or bake. Any shape can be used for deep frying.

(9, 'Konafa', 'A Middle-Eastern favorite and a month of Ramadan tradition. This variation of Konafa is made from crunchy shredded phyllo pastry, sandwiching a creamy, pudding-like filling, and soaked with a scented simple syrup.', 'FOR THE SCENTED SIMPLE SYRUP:*\r\n 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar\r\n 1 cup (237ml) water\r\n Squeeze of lemon\r\n 1/2 teaspoon orange blossom water, optional*\r\n 1/4 teaspoon rose water, optional*\r\nFOR THE CREAM-FILLING:\r\n 1 1/2 cup (355ml) whole milk\r\n 1 1/2 cup (355ml) heavy whipping cream*\r\n 3 tablespoons (38g) granulated sugar\r\n 5 tablespoons (35g) cornstarch\r\n 2 small or 1 medium piece of mastic (mistika), ground into fine powder (optional)*\r\n 2 teaspoons orange blossom water, optional*\r\n 1 teaspoon rose water, optional*\r\nFOR THE KONAFA CRUST:\r\n 1 lb/ 500g konafa (kataifi/kadayef dough), fresh or frozen. If using fresh, freeze for an hour for easier cutting. If using frozen, thaw slightly*\r\n 1 cup (227g) melted ghee (or clarified butter)', 'TO MAKE THE SCENTED SIMPLE SYRUP:\r\nIn a medium saucepan, combine together the sugar, water and squeeze of lemon juice. Set on the stove top over medium high heat. Try to avoid stirring it as it heats to prevent crystallization from happening, but if the sugar is not dissolving, then help it out with a few stirs. Once it comes to a boil, STOP stirring.\r\nBring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for no longer than 10 minutes. Set a timer! The syrup will thicken slightly, and have a consistency similar to hot pancake syrup. If it simmers for longer it could thicken too much and become candy-like and not pourable. Stir in the orange blossom and rose water, if using.\r\nTransfer to a medium bowl or gravy boat and allow to cool to room temperature before using.\r\nTO MAKE THE CREAM FILLING:\r\nIn a small saucepan, off the heat, whisk together the milk, cream, sugar and cornstarch until well combined and the cornstarch has dissolved completely without any visible lumps.\r\nSet the saucepan over medium high heat and bring to a full boil, whisking constantly. Continue to boil for about one minute until the mixture thickens and large bubbles form around the surface.\r\nRemove the saucepan from the heat and whisk in the ground mastic, orange blossom and rose water, if using.\r\nSet the cream-filling aside to cool slightly as you prepare the konafa crust.\r\nTO MAKE THE KONAFA CRUST:\r\nAdjust the oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat the oven to 200C/390F. Heavily grease with ghee or butter a 28cm/11-inch cake pan. Set aside.\r\nOver a large bowl, shred the konafa/kataifi dough into 1inch/ 2.5cm long pieces. I\'ve found that cutting the konafa while semi-frozen, makes for the easiest way to break it. So even if using fresh kunafa, stick it in the freezer for about an hour before cutting it.\r\nPour the melted ghee (or clarified butter) over the konafa. Rub the ghee (or clarified butter) with you hands, into the konafa shreds, making sure they\'re well coated and every strand is glistening.\r\nTransfer two-thirds the amount of konafa in the prepared pan and firmly press it on the bottom and up the sides. Make a wall with the konafa around the sides of the pan; this will help contain the cream filling during the baking process and prevent it from burning. Pack the konafa as tightly as possible. Use the bottom of a drinking or measuring cup, to help pack it tightly and smooth out the konafa.\r\nPour the cream filling into the konafa crust. I like to strain it in through a sieve to smooth out any skin or lumps that might have developed as it was cooling down.\r\nSpread the filling with a spatula or the back of a spoon into an even layer.\r\nScatter on the remaining third of the konafa over the cream filling, lightly press it on to adhere. At this point, you can cover the konafa and refrigerate until you\'re ready to bake; up to 24 hours or bake right away.\r\nWhen ready to bake, transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the top and sides of the konafa are deep golden brown in color, and has pulled away from the sides of the pan. Use a knife to push the side of the konafa, to check the color. The longer it bakes, the crunchier it will be. So bake it for less time if you prefer a softer crust.\r\nRemove the konafa from the oven and immediately pour on the room temperature syrup, starting from the edge and moving towards the center, in a circular motion, making sure to cover the entire surface.
